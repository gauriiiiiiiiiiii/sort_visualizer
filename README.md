## ⚙️ Features

### 💻 **Algorithm Showcase**
Witness a dazzling array of popular sorting algorithms in action! See how they gracefully (or sometimes chaotically! 🌪️) arrange data:

- **Bubble Sort**: Watch elements "bubble up" to their correct positions. 🎈
- **Selection Sort**: Discover how the smallest (or largest) element is repeatedly picked and placed. 🎯
- **Insertion Sort**: Observe elements being built into a sorted array one at a time. 🃏
- **Merge Sort**: Dive into the divide-and-conquer strategy, splitting and merging sorted subarrays. 🧩➡️🔗
- **Quick Sort**: Experience the power of partitioning and recursive sorting. ⚡
- **Heap Sort**: See how a binary heap structure is leveraged for efficient sorting. 🌳
- **Tim Sort**: Explore a hybrid sorting algorithm, a blend of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. 🔄
- **Counting Sort**: Understand non-comparison sorting based on counting occurrences. 🔢
- **Radix Sort**: Visualize sorting by processing individual digits. 🔟
- **Shell Sort**: Witness an optimization of Insertion Sort, allowing exchanges of elements far apart. 🐚

### 📏 **Array Size Customization**
Take control! **Choose the number of elements** in your array (from a small **5** 🤏 to a mighty **100** 💪) to see how algorithms scale.

### ⏱️ **Speed Control Maestro**
You're the conductor! 🎶 Adjust the visualization speed to your liking:

- **Slow Motion (0.25x)**: Perfect for detailed step-by-step analysis. 🐢
- **Standard (1.00x)**: A balanced view of the sorting process. 🚶‍♂️
- **Fast (4.00x)**: For quick overviews and high-level understanding. 💨
- **Chaos Mode**: Brace yourself for a wild, unpredictable visual spectacle! 🤪

### 📊 **Real-time Performance Metrics**
Get the inside scoop! Monitor the efficiency of each algorithm with live, dynamically updating statistics:

- **Time**: Track the actual duration of the sorting process in milliseconds. ⏱️
- **Comparisons**: Count every single comparison made between elements. ⚖️
- **Swaps**: See every direct exchange of two elements. ↔️
- **Moves**: Understand data shifts and placements, especially crucial for non-comparison sorts. ➡️

### 🎨 **Dynamic & Engaging Interface**
- **Interactive Title**: The "Sort Visualizer" title greets you with a playful, jumbled effect that elegantly settles into place upon your first interaction. ✨
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless and beautiful experience on any device, from mobile phones 📱 to large desktops 🖥️.
- **Auditory Feedback**: Subtle sound effects accompany comparisons and swaps, adding another layer to your learning experience. 👂🔔
